This is a simple single linked list, works as a stack.
There is no need for optimisation yet.
This works with pointers.

WARNING! The name of this class is currently a misnomer.
This "LList" class needs to be renamed "LStack" since it acts as a stack.

template<T>

Node<T>:
	-data
	-next
end

LList<T>:
	T* Push(T*)
	T* Pop()
	
	T* Head();
	
	-head
end
