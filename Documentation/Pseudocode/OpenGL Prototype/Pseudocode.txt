TODO:

Create a model class, to deal with the ingame rendering.
Create a scene where I can move around.

-------------------------

This model will read in .raw files or a custom file format from blender 2.49a
There will be no quads for now
This method is bulky, but simple

struct Point: GLfloat[3]
struct Triangle: Point[3]

Mesh:
	/* Public access members */
	Constructor
	Destructor
	
	Load(szFileName)
	Save(szFileName)
	
	Render()
	
	/* Private access members */
	LList<Triangle> array
end
